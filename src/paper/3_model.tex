The core of the project is to demonstrate the working of the human capital accumulation mechanism in light of demographic transitions.

In order to focus on the human capital accumulation mechanism, the following simplifying assumptions are made:

Households do not value leisure or, vice versa, do not incur disutility from labor. While abstracting from the labor-leisure choice, one key margin of adjustment of the household is disabled. The remaining trade-off in the labor supply decision solely consists of investing time in earning labor income versus investing time in accumulating / maintaining human capital for higher future productivity. On one hand, this substantially simplifies the computational problem and on the other hand, the labor-leisure trade-off is removed from the analysis, thus making clearer the role of endogenous human capital accumulation.



To further reduce the computational burden, the following simplifying assumptions are made:

Model age zero corresponds to real age 20
