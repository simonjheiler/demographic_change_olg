This term paper reproduces the human capital accumulation mechanism in an economy with demographic change developed by \cite{LudwigSchelkleVogel2012}. Goal of the paper is to qualitatively replicate the core features of endogenous human capital accumulation as a response to changes in the old-age dependency ratio, while abstracting from any additional features contained in the original paper. The focus lies on providing insights into the setup and solution of a model in which households are subject to demographic change as well as demonstrating strengths and limitations of the particular implementation used to solve the model.\footnote{This term project has been created using code provided by Prof. Brendler of the University of Bonn and a template for reproducible projects in computational economics by \citet{GaudeckerEconProjectTemplates}}
