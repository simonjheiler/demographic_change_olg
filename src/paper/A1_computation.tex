Human capital is discretized on a logarithmic grid with bounds $[1.0, 5.0]$ with 20 grid points.
Capital is discretized on a linear grid with bounds $[0.001, 30.0]$ with 60 grid points.

The tolerance level for deviations in aggregate capital and aggregate labor are set to $10e-5$, both for computation of stationary equilibria and transitional dynamics.
